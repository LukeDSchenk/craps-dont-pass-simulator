I made this for fun in about 15 minutes sitting at the airport in Las Vegas. I had won about $100 the weekend prior using this strategy, and I was curious to know just how lucky I was. This simulator mainly just makes it extremely clear that the more rolls you play, the greater chance you have of losing all of your money to the house. Set a reasonable goal for yourself and leave if you reach it! The longer you play, the more the house advantage will bite you in the ass.
